# The_Key_RFID

A placeholder repository for investigating the security of my travelcard, "[The Key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Key_(smartcard))" - I had this idea when I scanned it with an RFID reader and noticed that the data on it was completely unencrypted, so thought I'd see how far I can push it.
